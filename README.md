# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I was motivated to build this project as I am keen to expand my skills and knowledge as a Software Developer. I wanted to understand the basics and to further my skills by learning and adding on to my arsenal. 
- I built this project to get an understanding of the different functions, roles and uses for basic HTML, CSS and JS coding. This project was intended for me to be able to start my development experience in the most basic manner.
- This project has allowed me to get familiar with HTML, CSS and JS basics as well as some general rules when it comes to coding. It has also helped me built a reference moving forward so as I can refer when revising and working on more slightly complex projects.
- In this project, I learned the different very fundamentals of coding, though there is still much more to learn, it gave me an indepth understanding of structures, good coding ettiquette among a bunch of other nuanced information.

This prework-study-guide is to help new developers like myself to get an understanding of coding basics. It is a good reference point for entry level developers and also includes JavaScript which can be seen once opening the DevTools Console.

The prework study guide also lists topics that have been covered and highlights how we were able to undertake this task in a self-learning approach.
